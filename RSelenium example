#It took quite some effort to get this running
#At the the end what worked was a docker installation on my linux box
#All earlier attempts of using a local web server for selenium have failed with over 10 hours invested in troubleshooting the errors
#A note to everyone, please get a docker-ce installation in case you are doing this for yourself
#Refer - https://ropensci.github.io/RSelenium/articles/RSelenium-docker.html which has good documentation and instructions
#Hope this helps someone else too!
#Sample script which was a success
#Data is beautiful!
